A beginner-friendly web-based Contact Management System that allows users to store, edit, delete, and view contact information.

How It Works
  
  The application loads any existing contacts from the browser's localStorage.
  When you add or edit a contact, the list updates and is saved in localStorage.
  You can delete individual contacts, and changes will be reflected immediately.
